## Overview
A dropdown menue

## How to use
A dropdown menue would appear by hovering or clicking the trigger. The menue content is passed to the `Content` props and trigger is the children.

## How's it developed
It's a wrapper of `Popover` with additional configurations, e.g.  "interaction", "trigger", "placement" and also display animation. 

*Since `Popover` is based on `floating-ui`, this is just an implementation of `floating-ui`*
